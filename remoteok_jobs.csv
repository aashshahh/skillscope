<p>Sage is on a mission to improve care and quality of life for older adults, starting with those residing in senior living facilities. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death among adults over 65. And yet, fall prevention and emergency response systems for older adults are archaic and ineffective. At Sage we've built a more modern way of understanding when older adults need help, including methods for residents to alert caregivers when in need of help, and corresponding software for caregivers to triage response. Our company mission is to create a product that our client counterparts love, and this role is a key part of that objective.</p>
<p>Sage is a small, tight team of ambitious, multi-disciplinary entrepreneurs. We are a software-enabled, mission-driven company, and are focused only on the problems that are central to achieving that mission.

<p>As Sageâs Brand Designer, youâll design the creative that defines how our brand is experienced externally and internally. Youâll partner closely with marketing, content, and product teams to create materials that tell a clear and compelling storyâthrough visuals that are strategic, consistent, and distinctly Sage.</p>
<p>Youâll own design execution across a wide range of formatsâfrom campaigns and presentations to environmental and event collateralâhelping ensure every expression of Sage feels intentional and aligned.</p>

<p>At Aztec, our goal is to add privacy to Ethereum.</p>
<p>In the current public blockchain paradigm, users and entities unknowingly broadcast data in the public, compromising privacy and security to get trustlessness.</p>
<p>Not only are unencrypted blockchains inherently privacy-exposing, they require significant redundancy to compute and verify the legitimacy of transactions.</p>
<p>Implementing scalable encryption in a public blockchain paradigm requires cutting-edge math and engineering. Thankfully, our team of scientists and engineers invented Plonk, the industry-standard zkSNARK, and Noir, the universal language of zero knowledge.</p>
<p>Now, weâre building a first of its kind Layer 2 with private smart contracts. This requires new cryptographic primitives, a zero-knowledge DSL for writing contracts, a privacy-friendly execution environment, a carefully designed set of circuits that prove the validity of the chain to L1, a decentralized block-building and proving mechanism, and a top-tier user and developer experience. And itâs now time to bring it to market.</p>
<p>Weâve raised $125 million from industry-leading investors including a16z crypto, Paradigm, Variant, Consensys, and a_capital, and weâre growing quickly.</p>
